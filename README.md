# osx-setup

This is a set of installation scripts that will get my environment going.

## What will this do

- Install homebrew and install the needed formulae.
- Install cask and install software.
- Install vim and configure it (plugins, etc)
- Configure fish and the location of the different directories.

## Thanks
